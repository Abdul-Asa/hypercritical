## 🎯 Why This Was Built

After my interview with Hypercritical's CTO, I wanted to demonstrate my ability to provide immediate value to their platform. I spent time analyzing their product architecture and identified the script generation flow as an area where streaming could significantly improve both performance and user experience.

**The Goal:** Show how modern streaming techniques can replace polling-based implementations while maintaining the same functionality but with better UX and performance characteristics.

## 🔍 What I'm Mirroring

This demo replicates **Hypercritical's test script generation workflow**, specifically:

### Core Functionality

- **AI-powered code generation** for control systems (Python/MATLAB)
- **Test script management** with sidebar navigation
- **Monaco editor integration** for code viewing/editing
- **Unit test and simulation test** generation types
- **Specialized prompts** for safety-critical control software

### UI/UX Patterns

- **Dashboard layout** with resizable panels
- **Test selection sidebar** with script metadata
- **Code viewer** with language switching
- **Generation controls** and status indicators
- **Edit mode** with save/undo functionality

The demo maintains the same **information architecture** and **user workflows** while implementing streaming under the hood.

## 🚨 Issues Identified

During my analysis of Hypercritical's platform, I identified several areas for improvement:

### 1. Polling-Based Code Generation

**Issue:** The script generation uses polling implementation (confirmed via network logs)

- Users wait without real-time feedback
- Potential memory leaks from indefinite retry loops
- Unnecessary HTTP requests during polling intervals
- Poor responsiveness compared to modern AI interfaces

**Solution:** Streaming implementation provides real-time character-by-character generation

### 2. Performance & Rendering Issues

**Issue:** Rerendering inefficiencies throughout the dashboard

- Simple actions like "Edit" trigger full dashboard re-renders
- Could scale poorly for projects with thousands of tests
- Impacts user experience during interactions

**Solution:** Optimized state management with Jotai atoms and proper React patterns

### 3. Responsive Design Gaps

**Issue:** UI doesn't adapt well to different screen sizes

- Poor tablet experience
- Layout breaks on smaller screens
- Inconsistent spacing and component sizing

**Solution:** Responsive design with Tailwind's container queries and adaptive layouts

### 4. Minor UX Issues

**Issue:** Several small but impactful user experience problems

- Notifications sometimes overlap action buttons
- Editor action buttons are split, making quick interactions less intuitive
- Inconsistent loading states and feedback

**Solution:** Cohesive design system with proper spacing, clear visual hierarchy, and consistent interaction patterns

> **Note:** These observations come from a place of genuine excitement about Hypercritical's platform. Having worked with the technologies in your stack (Next.js, Tailwind, Zod), I see many opportunities to refine the experience while maintaining the excellent core functionality.

## 🛠 How It Was Built

This demo was built over a weekend to showcase immediate value I could provide to Hypercritical's platform. Here's my approach:

### 1. Product Analysis

- **Reverse-engineered** the existing script generation flow
- **Analyzed network logs** to confirm polling implementation
- **Identified UI/UX patterns** to maintain consistency
- **Studied the tech stack** (Next.js, Tailwind, TypeScript)

### 2. Architecture Decisions

- **Vercel AI SDK** on backend for robust streaming
- **Custom streaming client** on frontend (no AI SDK dependency)
- **Jotai atoms** for optimized state management
- **Monaco Editor** to match existing code viewing experience

### 3. Implementation Strategy

- **Maintain existing workflows** - users shouldn't notice the difference
- **Enhance performance** - streaming instead of polling
- **Improve responsiveness** - better mobile/tablet experience
- **Add visual feedback** - real-time generation progress

### 4. Key Technical Choices

**Backend (Edge Runtime)**

```typescript
// Streaming endpoint using Vercel AI SDK
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const result = streamText({
    model: openai("gpt-4o"),
    system: controlSystemsPrompt,
    prompt: userPrompt,
    temperature: 0.1,
  });

  return result.toTextStreamResponse({
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "text/plain; charset=utf-8",
      "Cache-Control": "no-cache",
      Connection: "keep-alive",
    },
  });
}
```

**Frontend (Custom Streaming)**

```typescript
// No Vercel AI SDK dependency on frontend
export async function streamCodeGeneration(
  options: StreamOptions,
  onChunk: (chunk: string) => void,
  onComplete: () => void,
  onError: (error: Error) => void
): Promise<void> {
  const response = await fetch("/api/generate-code", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify(options),
  });

  const reader = response.body?.getReader();
  const decoder = new TextDecoder();

  while (true) {
    const { done, value } = await reader.read();
    if (done) break;

    const chunk = decoder.decode(value, { stream: true });
    onChunk(chunk);
  }
}
```

**State Management**

```typescript
// Optimized atoms to prevent unnecessary re-renders
export const scriptsAtom = atom<ScriptItem[]>(mockScripts);
export const selectedScriptAtom = atom<ScriptItem | null>(null);
export const updateScriptAtom = atom(
  null,
  (get, set, { scriptId, updates }: UpdateScriptAction) => {
    const scripts = get(scriptsAtom);
    const updatedScripts = scripts.map((script) =>
      script.scriptId === scriptId ? { ...script, ...updates } : script
    );
    set(scriptsAtom, updatedScripts);
  }
);
```

## 🎯 Technical Implementation

### Backend (Edge Runtime)

```typescript
// Streaming endpoint using Vercel AI SDK
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const result = streamText({
    model: openai("gpt-4o"),
    system: controlSystemsPrompt,
    prompt: userPrompt,
    temperature: 0.1,
  });

  return result.toTextStreamResponse({
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "text/plain; charset=utf-8",
      "Cache-Control": "no-cache",
      Connection: "keep-alive",
    },
  });
}
```

### Frontend (Custom Streaming Client)

```typescript
// Custom streaming implementation without Vercel AI SDK dependency
export async function streamCodeGeneration(

  const decoder = new TextDecoder();

  while (true) {
    const { done, value } = await reader.read();
    if (done) {
      onComplete();
      break;
    }
    const chunk = decoder.decode(value, { stream: true });
    onChunk(chunk);
  }
}
```

### State Management

- **Jotai atoms** for reactive state management
